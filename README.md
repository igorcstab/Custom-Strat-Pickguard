# Licensing

Long story short, the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) basycally says although you can use the software licenses for hardware, it's not ideal. Also, if you really open the GNU GPL license text, for example, and read it once in your life, you'll have to agree it's only suited for software even though people use it for other types of products. So the OSHWA suggests the use of a software license for licensing software, a dedicated license for documentation and a proper hardware license on your project.

Well, this project is not properly a serious hardware thing but also it's definetely not software so I'm licensing it under **CERN-OHL-W-V2** and you can read all about it in the licenses folder if you have the patience and the will to do so.

# Repo Organisation

I didn't go hardcore here because it's a simple (although a long) project and I'd like to have different versions to compare my designs. Then files with different names in the same folder just works and there's no reason to complicate any more, so **src** contains source files and **dst** contains "distributables", which means vector files for laser cutting/milling/rounting, a cool GIF, the pdf versions, etc

# I like telling stories

So, back in 2010 I just got into high school and was starting to listen to metal. Jumped from Queen, Kiss and Nirvana to Metallica, SOAD and Slayer. Also, my brother was having acoustic guitar lessons at the time but I just didn't want to do it because "I didn't like chord instruments" (and, come on, it's not the genre I liked). One day I grabbed his old nylon acoustic guitar and tried to learn Seek and Destroy from an online lesson with tabs. It sounded easy enough: you just have to count the frets, put your finger on the indicated place and play along. Turns out I was spending quite a few hours learning that Metallica classic untill I was able to play it fairly well given the conditions (except the solo, of course, but I could play the whole rhythm guitar parts of the song). My father offered me to buy a guitar as a Christmas gift and I took it as I'm not the kind of getting/asking for gifts. It made sense at the time.

I choosed a stratocaster, all single coils, black body, dark fretboard, don't remember the woods, white pickguard, 21 frets, Squier bulletstrat, made in China. Way better than the nylon guitar, not the ideal instrument for what I really wanted to play but it was a good compromise between spending too much on my first guitar or being cheap and getting a crappy one. Still, it made me pretty happy as I could play Nirvana and Black Sabbath fairly well. I have the setting on my amp that sounds **exactly** the same as Tony Iommi records. However, I also wanted to play other things and realized my guitar wasn't the ideal instrument to play anything. It didn't stop me though but it always felt a little out of place.

By 2016 I bought a Zoom G1Xon to experiment a little with effects and to try to make my guitar sound better. Also, at that time, I've just entered college, my whole routine changed and I started to get involved with other things that consumed practically all my free time. I knew I needed a humbucker for both reasons: those pickups are what it's used to play what I wanted to play and kind of the whole effects things are more based on humbuckers and don't sound the same on single coils. As I couldn't find a way to keep evolving my instrument and didn't have time to practice, I lost motivation but always missed the times I played for hours until I realized I was hungry or thirsty and it was time to stop.

So it seems there's a deadly virus killing millions of people around the world, economies took a big hit and I'm forced to live inside a cell I used to call "bedroom" for more hours a day than it's healthy even for a prisoner. Also, I've found a good humbucker that isn't an import, which means it wouldn't cost me a kidney and should sound good because it isn't a chinese crappy one. So I bought it as a birthday gift for myself and I've been wanting to start to play again. Bought a metal guitar theory course to get back on tracks, planned the new electronics of my guitar, bought the components, drafted how I'd renovate my guitar aaaaand I had the idea of making an art on my pickguard. Something meaningful to me. Something I'd be proud of. As I've spent the last years soldering and welding instead of drawing, reading datasheets instead of poetry, and coding instead of writing touchy things. That'd be a challenge: making art. Now it's almost 2 years since I had this initiative and now I have plenty of free time (and good mental health) to end what I started. It has been a couple of versions, couple of different ways of trying to draw it but I feel I'm satisfied with what I made and with the fact some of the heaviest guitarist use "classic" guitars instead of "metal" guitars like Jim Root and Joe Duplantier. I used a 1px grid and drew/positioned **every single** trace by hand on Inkscape. I generated some fractals using L-systems based on the book "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer" then I made several puzzles until it looked how I envisioned it then I proceeded to an obscene amount of routing hours (if you can call it "routing"). Right in this line you're reading at this moment I wrote something about how I interpreted/foresaw it, but I erased it. Well, let's say now I give more value to the meaning of art and its interpretations so I'll leave it to you instead. Doing such an unusual project sounds pretty useless, specially when you dedicate something above 30 hours (actually I lost track of the time but I definitely hit that mark). Still, the very small things I practiced and learned on this project are priceless to me and maybe they wouldn't be if I gave up or found a easier way of doing it. **If you spend any time doing something different, it's always time well spent**. Anyway, thanks for reading!
